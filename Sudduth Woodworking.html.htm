<h1>My Woodworking Journey</h1>

<p>My name is David and I've been woodworking for the past 6 years or so. I am a self-taught hobbyist, learning through trial and error. I enjoy solving the puzzle of making an idea take physical shape. My site will cover why I love doing this and some of the evolution of my capability.</p>

<h2>How I Got Started</h2>

<p>My jouney began with a simple request from my wife to refurbish our end-tables. They had made a couple of trips across the country with us and were really beat up. After working for two weeks to hand-sand these tables using the tailgate of my truck as a workbench, I decided I needed better tools and the proper work space to do the job properly. Six years later, my garage is a fully functional wood shop and my house is full of things I've made for everyday use as well as DIY repairs and upgrades. Below you will see the evolution of my workbench as my projects have become more complex</p>

<h3>My Favorite Tools</h3>

<p>My oldest and most favorite tool is my miter saw. I picked it up at a flea market in North Carolina for 60 dollars and it is still going strong.  I usee it on almost every single project that requires me to cut a piece of wood.  Aside from that, my speed square and eternally misplaced pencil are the tools that are the most important to me. The most interesting tool, and the newest, is my lathe. I'm still learning the finer points of wood turning, but have made several cups out of an old fence post as practice. The images below are some progress photos of the entertainment center I built for my living room.</p>
